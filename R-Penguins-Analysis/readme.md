# Palmer Penguins Analysis (R + RMarkdown)
This project demonstrates my learning and application of data analysis in R using the Palmer Penguins dataset. It was completed as part of my journey in the Google Data Analytics Certificate.

## Project Objectives
- Import, explore, and clean data using R
- Practice key tidyverse functions including `filter()`, `mutate()`, `group_by()`, and `summarise()`
- Visualize patterns in the data using `ggplot2`
- Document the entire process using RMarkdown

## Topics Covered
- Installing and loading packages (`tidyverse`, `palmerpenguins`)
- Data import and export
- Data cleaning: handling missing values, renaming columns
- Data transformation and filtering
- Summary statistics by group
- Creating and customizing visualizations
- Using pipes (`%>%`) for readable code
- Final summary and key learnings

## Files Included
- `penguins_analysis.Rmd`: Full RMarkdown file (code + explanations)
- `penguins_analysis.pdf`: Knitted report output

## Tools Used
- R
- RStudio / Posit Cloud
- Tidyverse
- ggplot2
- RMarkdown

## Dataset Source
The dataset comes from the [palmerpenguins](https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins) R package, developed for teaching data analysis in R.
